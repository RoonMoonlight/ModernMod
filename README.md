# ModernMod
ModernMod is the sister project of EnhancedMod project. It is basically EnhancedMod but only supports specific platform. It is distinguished from main EnhancedMod due to lack of cross-platform features.

# Disclaimer
If the project only supports Windows and you are using Linux, you may also try using Linux with Proton/Wine, but we cannot provide assistance since Wine and Proton works differently with Windows native and may contain several crashes and errors. If you are reporting any isssues you found on this project and you are using Wine/Proton, please confirm it on Windows native if same bug happens. Failure to provide any proof that the bug also happens to Windows native version will result in a issue not going to be fixed.

tl;dr - Use at own risk.
